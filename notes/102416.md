Coupling
=========
- Dependency between multiple classes
- Preferably: low coupling rather than high coupling

Parameter Variable
------------------
- Passed in as values, not references, meaning that parameter variables don't get updated. You get a copy of the object, so the actual doesn't get changed.

```java
public class BankAccount{
	public double balance;
	// Bad because BankAccount object in BankAccount
	public void transfer(double amount, BankAccount otherAcct){

		// not recommended because amount is modified (not accessible anymore)
		amount = amount + 5

		double amount1 = amount + 5  // recommended because different
		balance = balance - amount;
		double newBalance = otherAcct.balance + amount;
	}
}
BankAccount a = new BankAccount(1000);
BankAccount b = new BankAccount(500);
a.transfer(100,b);
```

Documentation of Methods
========================
- Preconditions and Postconditions

Precondition
-------------
- Condition before program started
- Requirement that the caller of a method must obey
- Caller (user) of the method is responsible to call the method correctly
-	If the method is called improperly anyway, the method is not responsible for producing a correct result
- Always after param (last line)
- Whenever method has parameters, there should be a precondition

```java
/**
 * Deposits money into this account
 * @param amount amount of money to deposit
 * (Precondition: amount >= 0)
 */
public void deposit(double amount){
	balance += amount;
	if (amount < 0)
		break;
}
```

Postcondition
-------------
- When a method is called in accordance to is precondiitons, then the method promises to do its job correctly
- No need for postcondition if it is redundant (see getBalance below)

```java
/**
 * Deposits money into this account
 * (Postcondition: balance >= 0)
 * @param amount amount of money to deposit
 * (Precondition: amount >= 0)
 */
public void deposit(double amount){
}

/**
 * Returns the current of this account
 * (Postcondition: the return value equals to the account balance)
 * ^ extra because repeated
 * @return the account balance
 */
public double getBalance(){
	return balance;
}
```

Static Methods (Class methods)
------------------------------
- A method that is not invoked on an object
- Simply implement the methods in the class and call it without constructing an object of that class

```java
public class Square{
	/**
	 * Returns the area of a square with the given side
	 * (Postcondition area > 0)
	 * @param side the length of the side of a square
	 * @return area the area of the square
	 * (Precondition side > 0)
	 */
	public static double getArea(double side){
		return side*side;
	}
}
```
---
Tester class:
```java
public class Tester{
	public static void main(String[] args){

		// not going to compile because no Square object
		System.out.println(Square.getArea(3));

		// changed getArea to static and now it works
		System.out.println(Square.getArea(3));
	}
}
```
