Exception Handling
------------------

Exceptions
==========

- An event which occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions.
- Two types of exceptions: Checked and Unchecked
    - Checked: Describes a problem that is likely to happen no matter how careful you are. Requires extra attention.
        - Unexpected end of file
    - Unchecked: The exception is your fault. Yo should have anticipated the exception and be able to deal with it. Does not need to be dealt with.
        - NullPointerException
        - IndexOutOfBoundsException

```java
import java.util.*;

public class ExceptionHandler {
    public void getAge(){
        Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.print("What is your age? ");
        try {
            int age = input.nextInt();
            System.out.println("What is your name? ");
            String name = input.nextLine();
        } catch (InputMismatchException e) { // exception handler
            System.out.println("Please be nice");
        }
    }

    public static void main (String [] args){
        ExceptionHandler example = new ExceptionHandler();
        this.getAge();
    }
}
```
